# syncthing-relay-discovery
Docker Container for the global relay server for the [http://syncthing.net/](http://syncthing.net/) project. I build the container because there was no official one. This build is listening on the gihub project of the relay server and gets updated whenever there is a code change. [relaysrv GitHub repo](https://github.com/syncthing/relaysrv) and [dicosrv GitHub repo](https://github.com/syncthing/discosrv). The container is intended for people who like to roll their own private syncthing "cloud".

The files for this container can be found at my [GitHub repo](https://github.com/t4skforce/syncthing-relay-discovery)

# About the Container

This build is based on [debian:latest](https://hub.docker.com/_/debian/) and installs the latests successful build of the syncthing relay and discovery server.

# How to use this image

`docker run --name syncthing-relay -d -p 22067:22067 --restart=always t4skforce/syncthing-relay-discovery:latest`

This will store the certificates and all of the data in `/home/syncthing/`. You will probably want to make at least the certificate folder a persistent volume (recommended):

`docker run --name syncthing-relay -d -p 22067:22067 -v /your/home:/home/syncthing/certs --restart=always t4skforce/syncthing-relay-discovery:latest`

If you already have certificates generated and want to use them and protect the folder from being changed by the docker images use the following command:

`docker run --name syncthing-relay -d -p 22067:22067 -v /your/home:/home/syncthing/certs:ro --restart=always t4skforce/syncthing-relay-discovery:latest`

Creating cert directory and setting permissions (docker process is required to have access):
```bash
mkdir -p /your/home/certs
chown -R 1000:1000 /your/home/certs
```

# Container Configuration

There are several configuarion options available. The options are configurable via environment variables (docker default):

Example enabling debug mode:
```bash
export RELAY_OPTS='-debug'
export DISCO_OPTS='-debug'
docker run --name syncthing-relay-discovery -d -p 22067:22067 -p 22026:22026 --restart=always t4skforce/syncthing-relay-discovery:latest
```

or

```bash
docker run --name syncthing-relay-discovery -d -p 22067:22067 -p 22026:22026 -e RELAY_OPTS='-debug' -e DISCO_OPTS='-debug' --restart=always t4skforce/syncthing-relay-discovery:latest
```

## Docker Compose

```bash
---
version: '3'

services:
  syncthing-relay-discovery:
    container_name: syncthing
    restart: always
    image: t4skforce/syncthing-relay-discovery:latest
    environment:
      RELAY_OPTS: '-debug'
      DISC_OPTS: '-debug'
    ports:
      - 22067:22067
      - 22026:22026
```
